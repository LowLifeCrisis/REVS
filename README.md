  This was created after futzing around with get-WinEvent -FilterHashTable to try and address an issue we were seeing with blocked traffic over TCP port 3389. I needed to search Event Viewer logs and was not able to log into the device remotely via RDP due to the afformentioned issues. Instead of doing the smart thing and just using my up arrow to rerun the command with different parameters, I decided to make this thing. It's ultimately just a questionnaire that uses the answers that you give it to run a Get-WinEvent, hands the data to Select-Object to ignore any of the boring fields, and finally hands the data to Export-CSV to create a searchable document.

  Make sure that you have at least part of either the provider name or log name that you are needing to find. Supplying nothing will most likely crash PS after a good long while of waiting. Two guardrails were put in place to protect me from myself: If the name field is empty or less than 4 characters you will be warned about what you are doing. Heed the warning or don't, you're a free person after all.

  File is exported to C:\temp. If this folder is missing for some reason the script will fail. The script is designed to run on an infinite loop until you answer anything other than y or yes to the final prompt.

No AI was used in making this. Any stupidity contained within belongs solely to me and it is my duty as a human to remain proud of that.
